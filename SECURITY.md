# Security Policy

## Overview

Code Safe is a security-focused application that helps identify vulnerabilities in Python codebases. As such, we take security very seriously and have implemented comprehensive security measures throughout our development lifecycle.

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Security Architecture

### Application Security

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Authentication**: Secure authentication mechanisms for API access
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC) implementation
- **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest and in transit
- **Secure Headers**: Implementation of security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)

### Infrastructure Security

- **Container Security**: Regular vulnerability scanning of Docker images
- **Network Security**: Network segmentation and firewall rules
- **Secrets Management**: Secure storage and rotation of API keys and secrets
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive security monitoring and alerting

### Development Security

- **Secure SDLC**: Security integrated throughout development lifecycle
- **Code Review**: Mandatory security-focused code reviews
- **SAST/DAST**: Static and dynamic application security testing
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular scanning of third-party dependencies

## Security Features

### Vulnerability Detection

Code Safe detects the following vulnerability types:

1. **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**
   - Unsafe use of `eval()`, `exec()`, `subprocess`
   - Unsafe deserialization (pickle, yaml)
   - Template injection vulnerabilities

2. **SQL Injection (SQLI)**
   - Unsanitized database queries
   - Dynamic SQL construction
   - ORM misuse patterns

3. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
   - Reflected XSS in web applications
   - Stored XSS vulnerabilities
   - DOM-based XSS patterns

4. **Local File Inclusion (LFI)**
   - Path traversal vulnerabilities
   - Unsafe file operations
   - Directory traversal attacks

5. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**
   - Unvalidated URL requests
   - Internal network access
   - Cloud metadata access

6. **Arbitrary File Overwrite (AFO)**
   - Unsafe file write operations
   - Path traversal in file uploads
   - Symlink attacks

7. **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)**
   - Missing authorization checks
   - Predictable resource identifiers
   - Privilege escalation vulnerabilities

### Security Controls

- **Confidence Scoring**: AI-powered confidence scoring (0-10) to minimize false positives
- **Context Analysis**: Deep code analysis including function call chains
- **Proof of Concept**: Detailed PoC exploits for verified vulnerabilities
- **Remediation Guidance**: Specific remediation steps for each vulnerability type

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take all security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in Code Safe, please report it responsibly.

### Reporting Process

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Send an email to: **security@codesafe.dev** (or create a private security advisory)
3. Include the following information:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested remediation (if any)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Fix Development**: Within 7 days (critical), 14 days (high), 30 days (medium/low)
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is deployed and users have time to update

### Security Advisory Process

1. We will acknowledge receipt of your report
2. We will investigate and validate the vulnerability
3. We will develop and test a fix
4. We will coordinate disclosure timing with the reporter
5. We will publish a security advisory with credits

## Security Best Practices for Users

### For Developers Using Code Safe

1. **API Key Security**
   - Store API keys securely (environment variables, secret managers)
   - Rotate API keys regularly
   - Use least-privilege access principles

2. **Code Upload Security**
   - Review code before uploading to ensure no sensitive data
   - Use private repositories when possible
   - Implement access controls on analysis results

3. **Result Handling**
   - Treat vulnerability reports as sensitive information
   - Implement proper access controls for reports
   - Follow responsible disclosure for found vulnerabilities

### For Organizations

1. **Integration Security**
   - Use secure CI/CD integration practices
   - Implement proper authentication and authorization
   - Monitor and audit Code Safe usage

2. **Data Governance**
   - Establish policies for code analysis
   - Implement data retention policies
   - Ensure compliance with regulatory requirements

## Security Compliance

Code Safe adheres to industry security standards:

- **OWASP Top 10**: Protection against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Implementation of NIST CSF controls
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management practices
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Security, availability, and confidentiality controls

## Security Monitoring

We continuously monitor our systems for security threats:

- **Real-time Monitoring**: 24/7 security monitoring and alerting
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regular automated vulnerability assessments
- **Penetration Testing**: Quarterly third-party penetration testing
- **Security Audits**: Annual comprehensive security audits

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring and manual reporting
2. **Assessment**: Rapid impact and scope assessment
3. **Containment**: Immediate containment of the threat
4. **Eradication**: Complete removal of the threat
5. **Recovery**: Restoration of normal operations
6. **Lessons Learned**: Post-incident analysis and improvements

## Security Training

Our development team receives regular security training:

- **Secure Coding Practices**: OWASP secure coding guidelines
- **Threat Modeling**: Regular threat modeling exercises
- **Security Testing**: Training on security testing methodologies
- **Incident Response**: Security incident response procedures

## Third-Party Security

We carefully vet all third-party dependencies:

- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning
- **License Compliance**: Verification of license compatibility
- **Supply Chain Security**: Verification of package integrity
- **Regular Updates**: Timely updates of dependencies
